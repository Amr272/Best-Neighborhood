# The Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh is...

### Bloomfield

Despite it's high crime rate, Bloomfield has 3 food growing locations (ranked 7th), 1 pool and 7 drinking fountains (ranked 3rd). Since two of our metrics immediately eliminated most of the neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, we had to choose one that overlapped with all four datasets: Grow Pittsburgh Food Gardens, Police Incident Blotter (30 Day), City of Pittsburgh Pools, and City of Pittsburgh Water Features. The only two neighborhoods that overlapped were Squirrel Hill South and Bloomfield.  Bloomfield was ranked 80th in terms of crime and Squirrel Hill South was ranked 87th.
